# Plutus
iOS application built with SwiftUI that provides users a way to easily compare cryptocurrencies to publicly traded companies/indexes

## Motivation
WhatTheHack? presented teams with a challenge to build a native iOS application. Something that could be helpful, unique, or just fun to use.

## Solution
With stock and cryptocurrency making headlines every other day, we had an idea to build an app that could make graphical 
(and later on, more fundamental) comparisons between the two. Standardizing the daily price histories of BTC and the S&P 500 and 
then plotting this data side-by-side on the same chart could offer unpredicted insights, for example.
